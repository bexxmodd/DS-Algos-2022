## Rotate n x n matrix by 90 degree

1) Transpose matrix (every i, j cell becomes j, i cell)
2) reverse matrix (every k, i cell becomes, k, j cell)

## Shifting Elements in an array

- use (i + k) % n formula to find new index of a shifted item, where i is the 
    ith element, k is the number of spots element is shifted and n is the size 
    of an array.
